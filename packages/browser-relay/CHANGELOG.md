# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Fixed browser relay support for multiple browser instances, such as Chrome and Edge, connected simultaneously. Tabs and relay requests now remain associated with the correct browser, while extensions without an instance identifier continue to use the existing single-browser behavior.

## [18.0.7] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- Clarified the scope of the two browser relay opt-in paths: per-call `app.relay: true` enables relay access for an individual call, while the `browser.relay` setting enables it by default across projects in a profile.

## [17.2.5] - 2026-08-03

### Added

- Initial release of the Chrome MV3 extension, enabling the omp browser tool to attach to and drive existing browser tabs via chrome.debugger.
- Added automatic, robust tab management that groups active agent-driven tabs into a dedicated per-window "omp" tab group and ensures clean dissolution upon disconnect.
