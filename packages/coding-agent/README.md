## Bash visualization

Embedded-shell calls default to Python-like **Pseudo**; switch to **Raw** for the original command. Syntax appears incrementally as the shell compiles it. Active commands retain their colors while inactive code fades; only failures get `×`. Values appear beside each variable's latest observed setter.

In Tern, the toggle and menu stay in the command segment; replay controls live in the inspector. In the inspector, `v` toggles Raw/Pseudo; `c/i/d/e/u` toggle color, inline variables, idioms, effects and embedded programs; `s` splits original/Pseudo. Space plays or pauses retained execution, arrows step, `r` resets, `l` returns live, and `−/+` changes speed. Escape closes.

Replay retains up to 20,000 records, 2 MiB output and 8 MiB payload; evictions are indicated. Effect badges are heuristic, not safety guarantees. Remote-script interiors are marked untraced; PTY/user-shell calls keep their plain command view.

## Session journal boundaries

Opt in with `sessionBoundaryRoot: /absolute/journal/root` in native configuration,
`OMP_SESSION_BOUNDARY_ROOT=/absolute/journal/root`, or
`--session-boundary-root /absolute/journal/root`. Precedence at launch is CLI/SDK
option, then inherited environment, then configuration. The canonical root stays
active for the process; changing projects or removing the environment variable
cannot loosen it. Each isolated host must set its own root and session storage
directory. This is a journal-loading policy, not a filesystem sandbox.

Native resume, fork, picker previews, SDK opens and interactive switches reject
outside-root journals before reading them, including symlinked files and existing
ancestors of missing paths. Under an active boundary, literal `..` path components
are rejected rather than normalized before symlink resolution. Same-root journals
and nested artifact-child journals remain available. SDK hosts opening a manager before `createAgentSession` must
first call the exported `configureSessionBoundaryRoot(root)` or inherit the
environment variable; passing `sessionBoundaryRoot` to `createAgentSession` also
rejects an already-open foreign manager before context construction.

Launchers must check that `omp --help` advertises `--session-boundary-root` before
writing isolation configuration or launching sessions: older versions report
unknown flags only after some startup reads. See [local proof/build steps](./DEVELOPMENT.md#session-boundary-proof-without-a-native-rebuild).

## Memory backends

The agent supports three mutually-exclusive memory backends, selected via the `memory.backend` setting (Settings → Memory tab, or `~/.omp/config.yml`):

- `off` (default) — no memory subsystem runs.
- `local` — existing rollout-summarisation pipeline; writes `memory_summary.md` and consolidated artifacts under the agent dir.
- `hindsight` — talks to a [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) server (Cloud or self-hosted Docker), retains transcripts every Nth user turn, recalls memories on the first turn of a session, and exposes `retain`, `recall`, and `reflect`.

### Hindsight quickstart

1. Run a Hindsight server (Cloud or `docker run -p 8888:8888 ghcr.io/vectorize-io/hindsight:latest`).
2. Set `memory.backend = "hindsight"` and `hindsight.apiUrl = "http://localhost:8888"` (or your Cloud URL).
3. Optional environment overrides (env wins over settings):
   - `HINDSIGHT_API_URL`, `HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN` — connection
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_DYNAMIC_BANK_ID`, `HINDSIGHT_AGENT_NAME` — bank addressing
   - `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RECALL`, `HINDSIGHT_AUTO_RETAIN`, `HINDSIGHT_RETAIN_MODE` — lifecycle
   - `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_BUDGET`, `HINDSIGHT_RECALL_MAX_TOKENS` — recall sizing
   - `HINDSIGHT_BANK_MISSION`, `HINDSIGHT_DEBUG`

Switching backends mid-session immediately replaces the live backend, memory tools, listeners, and system-prompt context. Existing users with `memories.enabled = true|false` are migrated to `memory.backend = "local"|"off"` exactly once on first launch; afterward, `memory.backend` is the sole runtime selector.
