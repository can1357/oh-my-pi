 *    (e.g. the disk filling) can truncate the destination — but the slow network
 *    transfer has already landed in the temp, and the temp is removed on failure.
 *    It also needs write permission on the file itself (a read-only file is
 *    refused, not silently replaced).
 *  - an existing special file (FIFO/socket/device) is refused, not replaced.
 *  - anything else (a new path, a symlink to a non-directory, a dangling symlink)
 *    is committed with an atomic rename, which REPLACES a symlink with a regular
 *    file rather than writing through it (resolving the link target is not
