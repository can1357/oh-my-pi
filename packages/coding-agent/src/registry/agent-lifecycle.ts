/**
 * AgentLifecycleManager - Owns the idle → parked → revived lifecycle of
 * adopted subagents.
 *
 * The task executor hands a finished agent over via {@link AgentLifecycleManager.adopt};
 * from then on the manager arms a TTL timer whenever the agent goes `idle`,
 * parks it on expiry (disposes the live session, keeps the AgentRef +
 * sessionFile), and revives it on demand through
 * {@link AgentLifecycleManager.ensureLive}. Only this manager flips
 * `parked` ↔ `idle`.
 *
 * Park/dispose is gated against concurrent ensureLive/hub-send:
 * - A disposing session is never handed out.
 * - ensureLive during an in-flight park either cancels the park (session still
 *   live) or waits for detach+park and then revives.
 * - Concurrent ensureLive/park operations coalesce per id.
 *
 * Every adoption, park, and revival is bound to the exact {@link AgentRef} it
 * started from, so stale async work (a late finalizer, a cancelled initializer,
 * a superseded revive) can never clobber a newer same-id ref.
