/**
 * Build the per-request `metadata` payload for the Anthropic provider, shaped
 * like real Claude Code's `getAPIMetadata` output (`{ session_id, account_uuid,
 * device_id }`) so the backend buckets requests under one session and attributes
 * them to the authenticated OAuth account when available. Resolved at request
 * time so token refreshes and login/logout transitions don't strand a stale
 * account UUID in memory. `account_uuid` and `device_id` are omitted for
 * non-Anthropic providers to avoid leaking the user's Claude identity to
 * third-party APIs (including Anthropic-format-compatible proxies such as
 * cloudflare-ai-gateway or gitlab-duo).
 *
 * Installed via `Agent#setMetadataResolver` on the main `AgentSession`, each
 * subagent session, and the separately constructed advisor `Agent` — each with
 * its own provider session id — so Main, subagent, and Advisor requests each
 * expose a distinct, stable provider-facing session identity.
 *
 * `provider` is the target provider string (e.g. `"anthropic"`) and gates the
 * `account_uuid` and `device_id` lookups — only `"anthropic"` requests carry them.
 *
 * `sessionId` is forwarded to the auth-storage session-sticky lookup so that
 * multi-credential setups attribute to the same OAuth account used for the
 * actual API request rather than always picking the first credential.
 *
 * `authStorage` is treated as optional so test fixtures that stub `modelRegistry`
 * without a real storage layer still work; the resolver simply skips the lookup
 * and emits `{ session_id }` alone, matching the no-OAuth-credential path.
