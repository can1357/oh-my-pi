# Autonomous Memory

Oh My Pi supports five memory modes. Memory is disabled by default; select one backend via `/settings` or `config.yml`:

| `memory.backend` | Storage and behavior                                                   | Guide                                                   |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `off`            | No memory backend                                                      | —                                                       |
| `local`          | Project-scoped summaries and lessons generated from persisted sessions | This page                                               |
| `hindsight`      | Remote, bank-scoped Hindsight memory                                   | [Hindsight](#hindsight-remote-backend)                  |
| `mnemopi`        | Local Mnemopi SQLite memory                                            | [Mnemopi memory backend](./mnemosyne-memory-backend.md) |
| `sharpshooter`   | Friction-gated project decision files (architecture/product/style), consolidated in the background | —                           |

Enable the local summary pipeline:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: local
```

## Running Sharpshooter alongside a backend

The backends above are mutually exclusive, with one exception. Sharpshooter distills project decisions into three markdown files instead of storing memories, so it needs nothing the backend slot provides and can run beside a store. Set `sharpshooter.enabled` to get searchable recall and always-on project decisions in the same session:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: mnemopi
sharpshooter:
  enabled: true
```

The selected backend keeps its identity and its tools; Sharpshooter adds its own startup work and appends its decision files to the injected instructions. `/memory stats`, `/memory diagnose` and `/memory queue` report on both. Memory search through the SDK adds Sharpshooter's hits to whatever the selected backend returns, which for `hindsight` is nothing, since it exposes no search of its own; its `recall` tool is unaffected. The flag is ignored when `memory.backend` is already `sharpshooter`.

A Sharpshooter failure never stops the selected backend, and the selected backend's own failures surface as they always did. Where a Sharpshooter failure shows up depends on which one it is: the wrapper logs a warning when Sharpshooter throws at a paired call, while a background consolidation that fails once it holds the bank lock records itself in the bank's state and reaches you through `/memory stats` and `/memory diagnose` rather than the log. A failure before that point does not: the state file lives inside the bank directory, so a directory the agent could not create has nowhere to record, and an error escaping the lock is reported to its caller, which the scheduler discards. Those reach the log alone.

`/memory clear` and `/memory sync` stay on the selected backend. Sharpshooter rewrites all three decision files whole on every consolidation and keeps no history, so neither a wipe nor a bad rewrite can be undone, and an action aimed at the store should not be able to cause one. Sharpshooter still consolidates on its own interval, so nothing is stranded. To clear or consolidate the decision files deliberately, select `sharpshooter` as the backend and use the command there.

Sharpshooter writes on its own schedule and calls a model to do it, using `sharpshooter.model` and consolidating every `sharpshooter.intervalMinutes`. Whether the session ends up with a second model-driven writer depends on the backend: `local` and `hindsight` write through a model, `mnemopi` does so only when `mnemopi.llmMode` is not `none`, and `off` adds nothing.

Enabling the flag starts Sharpshooter for a project that was not running it before, so consolidation now has to hold up on its own. The prompt asks for the complete content of all three files, and a reply returning fewer is refused before anything is written and before any delta is consumed.

That refusal is there because accepting a partial reply loses work with nothing to show for it. Only returned files are written, so an omitted file would keep its old content while the consolidation went on to mark every queued delta consumed, and any decision bound for that file would be gone without a record. Refusing leaves the deltas in place for the next cycle, which is the only outcome that loses nothing. Emptying a file remains a decision the admission law allows, from a reply that covered all three.

## Usage

### What gets injected

At session start, if a consolidated summary or manually captured lesson exists for the current project, it is injected into the system prompt as a **Memory Guidance** block. The summary and lessons share `memories.summaryInjectionTokenLimit`.

- Treat memory as heuristic context — useful for process and prior decisions, not authoritative on current repo state.
- Cite the memory artifact path when memory changes the plan, and pair it with current-repo evidence before acting.
- Prefer repo state and user instruction when they conflict with memory; treat conflicting memory as stale.

### Reading memory artifacts

The agent can read memory files directly using `memory://` URLs with the `read` tool:

| URL                                    | Content                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| `memory://root`                        | Compact summary injected at startup  |
| `memory://root/MEMORY.md`              | Full long-term memory document       |
| `memory://root/learned.md`             | Lessons captured by the `learn` tool |
| `memory://root/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` | A generated skill playbook           |
| `memory://<memory-id>`                 | Full Mnemopi memory row (working or episodic) with a YAML frontmatter metadata header; only available when `memory.backend` is `mnemopi` |

The `memory://<memory-id>` form returns the full stored row rather than the clipped recall preview (recall content that exceeds the preview cap ends with a trailing `…`); agents are instructed to read it before any `memory_edit update`.

The `memory://root[/…]` rows are file-backed and only exist with `memory.backend: local`, which populates the on-disk memory root via the consolidation pipeline. Under `hindsight` or `mnemopi` the root is never written, so those URLs do not resolve — use `recall`/`reflect` (and `read memory://<memory-id>` on `mnemopi`) instead.

### `/memory` slash command

| Subcommand            | Effect                                                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `view`                | Show the current backend injection payload                |
| `stats`               | Show backend-specific memory statistics, when supported   |
| `diagnose`            | Show backend-specific diagnostics, when supported         |
| `queue`               | Show pending memory deltas awaiting consolidation         |
| `sync`                | Run memory consolidation now                              |
| `clear` / `reset`     | Delete active backend memory data/artifacts               |
| `enqueue` / `rebuild` | Force consolidation/retention work for the active backend |
| `mm …`                | Hindsight mental-model maintenance (`list`/`show`/`refresh`/`history`/`seed`/`delete`/`reload`); unsupported in ACP mode |

### Capturing lessons

Enable `autolearn.enabled` to make the `learn` tool available:

```yaml
autolearn:
  enabled: true
```

With the local backend active, `learn` saves explicit durable lessons to the project's `learned.md`. Lessons are newest-first, deduplicated, secret-redacted, capped at 100 entries, and injected starting with the next session; a `learn` call does not mutate the active session's prompt-cache prefix. Each lesson's content is capped at 2,000 characters and optional context at 400 characters. Structured memory search, `recall`, `retain`, `reflect`, and `memory_edit` are not available for the local backend.

## How it works

Local summary memories are built by a background pipeline that runs at startup; `/memory enqueue` marks consolidation work that the next startup picks up. The pipeline is skipped for subagents and for sessions that are not persisted to a session file.

**Phase 1 — per-session extraction:** For each past session that has changed since it was last processed, a model reads the session history and extracts durable signal: technical decisions, constraints, resolved failures, recurring workflows. Sessions that are too recent, too old, currently active, or beyond the configured scan/age limits are skipped. Each extraction produces a raw memory block and a short synopsis for that session.

**Phase 2 — consolidation:** After extraction, a second model pass reads all per-session extractions and produces three generated outputs written to disk:

- `MEMORY.md` — a curated long-term memory document
- `memory_summary.md` — the compact text injected at session start
- `skills/` — reusable procedural playbooks, each in its own subdirectory

The separately maintained `learned.md` is not overwritten by consolidation.

Phase 2 uses a lease and heartbeat to prevent double-running when multiple processes start simultaneously. Stale skill directories from prior runs are pruned automatically.

Consolidated output is redacted for common secret/token patterns before `MEMORY.md`, `memory_summary.md`, or generated skills are written to disk.

### Extraction behavior

Memory extraction and consolidation behavior is driven by static prompt files in `packages/coding-agent/src/prompts/memories/`.

| File                      | Purpose                                          | Variables                                   |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- |
| `stage_one_system.md`     | System prompt for per-session extraction         | —                                           |
| `stage_one_input.md`      | User-turn template wrapping session content      | `{{thread_id}}`, `{{response_items_json}}`  |
| `consolidation_system.md` | System prompt for cross-session consolidation    | —                                           |
| `consolidation.md`        | User-turn prompt for cross-session consolidation | `{{raw_memories}}`, `{{rollout_summaries}}` |
| `read-path.md`            | Memory guidance injected into live sessions      | `{{memory_summary}}`, `{{learned}}`         |

### Model selection

Memory piggybacks on the model role system.

| Phase                   | Role                                                                | Purpose                          |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Phase 1 (extraction)    | `default`                                                           | Per-session knowledge extraction |
| Phase 2 (consolidation) | `smol` (falls back to `default`, then current/first registry model) | Cross-session synthesis          |

If the requested memory role is not configured, memory model resolution falls back to the `default` role, then the active session model, then the first model in the registry.

## Hindsight remote backend

Hindsight requires a reachable [Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io/) server. The default endpoint is `http://localhost:8888`; set a token when the server requires authentication:

```yaml
memory:
  backend: hindsight
hindsight:
  apiUrl: http://localhost:8888
  apiToken: ${HINDSIGHT_API_TOKEN}
```

`HINDSIGHT_*` environment variables override `hindsight.*` settings, which override built-in defaults. See the [complete Hindsight environment-variable table](./environment-variables.md#hindsight-memory-backend) for all 18 supported overrides, accepted values, parsing rules, precedence, and defaults.

By default, Hindsight uses `per-project-tagged` scoping: writes go to a shared bank with a project tag, while recall includes project-tagged and untagged global memories. `per-project` isolates each working-directory project in its own bank; `global` uses one shared bank. An explicit `hindsight.bankId` selects the bank base. Changes to the bank ID, prefix, or scoping rebuild the primary session state so later operations use the new scope.

Both project-scoped modes name the project the same way: take the repository's primary checkout root (so every linked worktree of one repository resolves to the same directory), then lowercase its basename. A checkout at `~/code/General` therefore tags `project:general`. Tags are matched literally, so this fold is what keeps one repository in one memory scope no matter how the path is capitalised.

The primary session recalls on its first model turn (`hindsight.autoRecall: true`) and automatically retains completed conversation turns every three user turns by default. `/memory enqueue` flushes queued tool retains and forces retention of the current session. At agent end, the primary state schedules cadence-based retention and flushes the retain queue; session disposal drains that queue before releasing the state. Request failures and configured timeouts are logged and leave the coding session usable. Subagents alias the parent's client, bank, and scope for explicit `recall`, `retain`, and `reflect` calls, but do not run their own automatic recall or retention.

Recall is injected as background context, not instructions, and recalled memory is also available as extra context during compaction. Selecting Hindsight exposes `recall`, `retain`, and `reflect`; `memory_edit` is not available because upstream Hindsight memories are not edited through this backend.

`/memory view`, `/memory stats`, `/memory diagnose`, and `/memory enqueue` operate through the active Hindsight state. `/memory clear` first drains pending retains, then clears only the local session state and recall cache. It **does not delete the server-side bank**; delete that bank with the Hindsight UI or API.
